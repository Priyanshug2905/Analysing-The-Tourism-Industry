#Project Repository

This repository will contain ALL the code, analysis, document and presentation for your group project.
1)To run the codes, you can simply set the working directory as the folder that you are in. We've arranged the files in such a manner that there won't be any need to cross access between folders. For example, if you want to run the shiny app, set the shiny app folder as the working directory. If you want to run the data extraction code, set the data extraction sub-folder within the FinalData folder as the working directory.

2)Following are the packages that we've used for project report. Before running the project report code, kindly ensure that these are installed. rvest, ggplot2, tidyverse, readxl, dplyr, plotl
